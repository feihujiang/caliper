## Caliper Introduction

Caliper is a general purpose blockchain benchmark framework, which allows users to test different blockchain solutions with predefined use cases, and get a set of perfomance test results.

Currently supported blockchain soultions:
* [fabric 1.0](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric)
* [sawtooth](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core) 

Currently supported performance indicators:
* Success ratio
* Transactions per second (TPS)
* Transaction committing delay
* Resource consumption (CPU, Memory, Network IO,...)

To learn more details , please refer to [Architecture introduction](doc/Architecture.md). 

## Build

### Pre-requisites

Make sure following tools are installed
* NodeJS 6.X
* Docker
* Docker-compose
* Blockchain system for test

Run `npm install` to install dependencies locally

### Install blockchain SDKs
* Fabric
  * Clone [fabric-sdk-node](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node) and run the headless tests to make sure everything is ok
  * Install **fabric-client** and **fabric-ca-client** from the SDK, e.g run `npm install path-to-sdk/fabric-client path-to-sdk/fabric-ca-client` in caliper's root folder, or just copy the `node_modules` from fabric-sdk-node project 
  
* Sawtooth
  * Clone [sawtooth-core](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core) and run the `./bin/run_tests -m javascript_sdk` to test the SDK
  * Install **sawtooth-sdk** from the SDK, e.g run `npm install path-to-sdk/javascript` in capliper's root folder.


## Start a test

All predefined benchmark tests can be found in *capliper/benchmark* folder, starting a test is very easy, following the step:
* Start the backend blockchain network for test manually. Now caliper does not support starting blockchain network automatically. Some example networks are defined in *caliper/network* folder.
  * Fabric - Fabric SDK supports creating channel and installing/instantiating smart contracts(a.k.a chaincodes) dynamically. Corresponding arguments can be defined in the configuration file (see the next step) and be used by fabric adaptor to prepare the test environment on demand.
  * Sawtooth - Sawtooth needs to install/instantiate smart contracts (a.k.a transaction families) manually. Corresponding arguments can be defined in the configuration file (see the next step) and be used by the sawtooth adaptor to prepare the test environment on demand. In the following example, the simple transaction family is started along with the sawtooth network. 
* Go into the use case folder you want to test, modify the configuration file to define the network started in step 1, as well as  other testing arguments. For more details of configuration, please refer to [Configuration Introduction](./doc/Architecture.md#configuration-file). 
* Run `node yourtest.js yourconfig.json` to start the test. Usually, the test file has the same name as the test case. If configuration file is not specified, *config.json* will be used by default.


Fabric Example:
```bash
# start a predefined fabric network
cd ~/caliper/network/fabric/simplenetwork
docker-compose up -d

# start the simple test case, default config.json is used
cd ~/caliper/benchmark/simple
node simple.js

# clear the environment after the test
docker-compose down
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```     

Sawtooth Example:
```bash
# start a predefined sawtooth network
cd ~/caliper/network/sawtooth/simplenetwork
docker-compose -f sawtooth-default-validators-simple.yaml up

# start the simple test case, config-sawtooth.json is used
cd ~/caliper/benchmark/simple
node simple.js config-sawtooth.json

# clear the environment after the test
docker-compose -f sawtooth-default-validators-simple.yaml down
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```   

## Write your own tests
Caliper provides a set of nodejs NBIs for applications to interact with backend blockchain system. Check the *src/comm/blockchain.js* to find the NBIs. Multiple *Adaptors* are implemented to translate the NBIs to different blockchain protocol. So developers can write a test  once, and run the test with different blockchain systems.

Generally speaking, to write a new caliper test, you need to :
* Write smart contracts for systems you want to test
* Write a test flow using caliper NBIs. Caliper provides a default test framework, which can be used easily to write a new test. For more details, please refer to [Test Framework](./doc/Architecture.md#test-framework) .       
* Write a configuration file to define the backend network and  test arguments.
